# Accessibility App EYE-EAR

This project is built for people with no disabilities and people with disabilities like auditive issues or visual issues.
It will display two videos, one movie and one tv show, as well as an audio song.

## Specifications

The entire design of the website has big measurements in order to make it easy to read, as well as high contrast colours with the same objective.

The video files will have controls such as play/pause, forward, backward and replay, also the videos count with the caption tools, so you will be able to
turn them on or off.

The audio file comes with HTML5 controls, but you will still be able to see the song lyrics in case you want to read them or have some auditive issue.

## Developer Notes

The steps that I will follow are:

1. This project will be built in HTML5, JS and CSS using SASS for modular styling.
2. I will make some controls for the video to be easy to watch, functions of play/pause, go forward 10 seconds, go backward 10 seconds and replay from the beginning.  
3. To turn the captions ON or OFF I will use some conditionals, that will activate or inactivate them depending on the html text inside the tag.
4. To display the lyrics I will make a toggle to hide and show the lyrics section.
5. The video formats need to be mp4 for the visualization and vtt for the captions according to 'MDN Web Docs' Website.

## Designer Notes

There will be a header with three different options (MOVIES, MUSIC and TV SHOWS) that are just for showing how the whole website would look if there were more content.
Then the tagline of the App name will be rendered in a big font size, after that there will be a big section with three smaller sections that will look like they are 
three cards, one audio card and two video cards. The colours the website will have are grey, white and gold, they generate a big contrast between themselves so it makes it more readable. 

The button that turns the captions ON or OFF will change colour, as the universally known colour: Green for ON and red for OFF. So it will be easier for people to realize the 
status of the captions, However if the person has colour visibility issues, inside the colour button there are the words 'ON' and 'OFF' that will show the person its status as well.
