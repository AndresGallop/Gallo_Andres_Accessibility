00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.680
And one more thing,
I had a good idea recently,

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.120
and that idea was to hook kids up
to what they think is a lie detector.

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.200
They think that because I lied to them
and told them it was a lie detector.

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.720
I think we've done this a few times now.
People seem to enjoy it.

5
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.880
So we went ahead and did it again,

6
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.920
this time with an adorable
young lady whose name is Joel.

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.640
Hello, how are you?

8
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.400
Now, this is the truth fairy.

9
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.760
The tooth fairy is going
to hook you up to this machine.

10
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.080
Go ahead and start doing that.

11
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.800
This is called a lie detector.

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.720
You know what that is, man?

13
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.360
A lie detector is a machine that is able

14
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.520
to know if you're telling
the truth or not.

15
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.000
OK, so I'm going to ask you
to just tell the truth,

16
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.040
the whole truth,

17
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.440
and not a half truth.

18
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.920
OK, OK.

19
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.360
Is that comfortable on your head?

20
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.520
OK, we're off to a bad start.

21
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.880
Just is that feels a little uncomfortable.
Right.

22
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.280
OK, what is your name.
Joe.

23
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.160
OK, Joel.
How old are you.

24
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.880
Five and a half.
And what grade are you in.

25
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.000
Kindergarten.
Kindergarten.

26
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.520
Do you like all the other kids at school?

27
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.800
If you know a few not who do
you have a problem with?

28
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.480
And one test playing in the playground.

29
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.600
This has been really moved site.

30
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.560
And like that guy, his name's Riley.
Riley.

31
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.920
OK, Riley.
All right.

32
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.960
Anybody else?

33
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.880
Nobody else.

34
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.360
Do you secretly love Riley

35
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.080
now?

36
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.360
A little bit

37
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.080
later.

38
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.520
Yes, sometimes that happens when boys will

39
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.960
tease girls at school and they're mean to
them, it's because they really like them.

40
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.000
Did you know that?
No.

41
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.640
So I have a feeling Riley
has a crush on you.

42
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.280
Mm hmm.
Have you ever killed anyone now?

43
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.680
OK.
Do you think you ever will kill anyone?

44
00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.800
No.
OK, that's good.

45
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.120
Do you know who let the dogs out?

46
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.560
Yeah. Whoo hoo hoo!

47
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.000
That's weird that it would do that, huh?

48
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.360
Are you always nice to the
other kids in your class?

49
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.040
Yes,

50
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.200
not always.

51
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.720
That matters.

52
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.360
Sometimes I'm like
I have a friend named Jaden and I'm going

53
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.760
to tell you because my child
and she just kept scabbed on it.

54
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.160
Oh, she scribbles gravel all over
your drawing and you tattled on her.

55
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.520
Yeah.

56
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.640
And you felt like that wasn't
a nice thing to do.

57
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.040
Yeah.

58
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.880
But why did she scribble
Scrabble all over your drawing?

59
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.640
I don't know.
That wasn't a nice thing for her.

60
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.200
Would you ever scribble Scrabble on her?

61
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.120
You would travel Scrabble on her drawing.

62
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.280
That's kind of what I thought.

63
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.120
All right. Do you have any secrets
that you're keeping from me?

64
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.520
Yes.
What are they?

65
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.520
I like the thing you like Griffin.
Who's Griffin?

66
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.080
He a blames when he.
He's very cute.

67
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.480
Oh, he is.

68
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.960
His name is Griffin.

69
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.040
Does he know you think he's cute?
Yeah.

70
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.960
Because Whitey chased me.
Huh.

71
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.080
That's how, you know,
you let him catch you now.

72
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.000
But secretly you want him
to keep chasing you, don't you?

73
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.760
Yes.

74
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.600
And that always the way.

75
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.400
That's why we can't figure women out.

76
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.760
I mean, what is it with you people?

77
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.400
You know,

78
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.600
anything you want to ask the truth.

79
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.120
Go ahead and make a big
gumball machine, ok?

80
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.200
OK, glad we got that settled.

81
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.280
Well, thank you very much.

82
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.680
It was very nice to meet you.

83
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.800
Thank you for telling
the truth most of the time.
