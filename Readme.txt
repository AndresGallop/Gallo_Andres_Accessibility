 #Accessibility App EYE-EAR

This project is build for people with no desabilities and people with disabilities like auditive issues or visual issues.
It will display two videos, one movie and one tvshow, as well as an audio song.

##Specifications

The entire design of the website has big measurements in order to make it easy to read, as well as a high contrast colourse with the same objective.

The video files will have controls such as play/pause, forward, backward and replay, also the videos count with the caption tools, so you will be able to
turn them on or off.

The audio file comes with HTML5 controls, but you will still be able to see the song lyrics in case you want to read them or have some auditive issue.

 ##Developer Notes

The steps that I will follow are:

1. This projec will be built in HTML5, JS and CSS usign SASS for modular styling.
2. I will make some controls for the video to be easy to watch, functions of play/pause, go forward 10 seconds, go backward 10 seconds and replay from the beggining.  
3. To turn the captions ON or OFF I wll use some conditionals, that will activate or unactivate them depending on the html text inside the tag.
4. To display the lyrics I will make a toogle to hide and show the lyrics section.
5. The video formats need to be mp4 for the visualization and vtt for the captions as follows 'MDN Web Docs' Website.

 ##Designer Notes

There will be a header with three different options (MOVIES, MUSIC and TV SHOWS) that are just for showing how the whole website would look like if there were more content.
Then the tagline of the App name will be rendered in a big font size, after that there will be a big section with three smaller sections that will look like they are 
three cards, one audio card and twoo video cards. The colours the website will have are grey, white an gold, they generate a big contrast between themselves so it makes it more
readable. 

The button that turns the captions ON or OFF will change of colour, as the universaly know colour: Green for ON and red for OFF. So it will be asier for people to realize the 
status of the captions, However if the person hav colour visibility issues, inside the colour button there are the words 'ON' and 'OFF' that will show the person its status aswell.
